_Unfortunately, I don't have access to VS2012 anymore so I can't really contribute any improvements unless I can find a maintainer._

# SassyStudio

SassyStudio provides a small amount of integration with Visual Studio to the experience using
Sass / SCSS a bit friendlier. Here's what we provide so far:

- Syntax Highlighting
- Outlining
- Generate css file on save
- Multiline Comments
- Intellisense completion support for variables, functions, mixins, and keywords
- Intellisense completion support for CSS syntax

In the near future I am planning to add support for the following (assuming VS/Web team doesn't add it first):

- Error integration

You can grab the extension from [the Visual Studio Gallery](http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/85fa99a6-e4c6-4a1c-9f00-e6a8129b6f4d)

If you are curious about what's coming next you can [take a look at the road map for the project](http://darrenkopp.com/posts/2013/09/10/SassyStudio-v06-and-roadmap.html).
